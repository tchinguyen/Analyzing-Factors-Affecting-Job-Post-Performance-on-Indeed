# Analyzing Factors Affecting Job Post Performance on Indeed
## Project Description

In recent years, recruiting quality individuals has been highly competitive for most companies. The HR department of a company wants to analyze what makes a job post more attractive to job seekers. The research question is how factors, from salary offered to the length of the job posting description, are associated with the number of views per job post. The goal is to identify what elements should be strengthened to attract more attention. After mutating the predictors, a Random Forest algorithm was run to determine the most important variables associated with the number of clicks on a job posting. A 10-fold cross-validation boosting algorithm was also run to confirm variable importance results. Results show that the duration of the job posting being online, job description length, estimated salary, and month that a job is posted are the four most important variables associated with the number of clicks on a job posting.

## Dataset Description

The dataset was attained from Indeed.com and contains various features relating to 14,586,035 job posts pulled from 2016 and 2017. Features include number of reviews of the company that posted the job, creation date of a job post, the country and state of a job post, estimated salary, length of a job description, and many more.

## Research Question

Throughout the exploration of the data, the focus is on identifying which statistically significant factors are the most associated with the number of clicks on a job post on Indeed.com, a major job recruiting website.
